project member- Aditya Kumar
rollno- 130101017
System id- 2013004280
supervisor- Khushboo Taneja
description- this project is about shopping in a store which rather than having all the items being physically present in the
display, are kept in a storage and their images with a QR Code attached eith them are put onto display. if a user wants to buy an item , he/she
can just scan the code of the item and it will be added to the cart.
when the cart is full as per the shoppers needs, a bill will be generated and the shopper can go to the payment counter to collect the goods and pay cash.

the application on the phone is developed on android studios and SQL Lite library to store the data of user and the products scanned.
the data of all items is stored in a database hosted on hostinger.com and the cashier can access the database with an html page or a java awt or swing window(yet to be decided)

the attached project contains the UI development of some of the pages and the scanning process which is still in development.
